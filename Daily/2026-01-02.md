## Notes

![[Daily.base]]
So it was day 2, and back to work it was. Today did [[WFH]] because it was given by the company. Anyhow, feeling quite confused at work, with lots of different things to do now, as PM. There's a lot of context switching that happens, and that's what's maybe creating a bit of anxiety or [[Imposter Syndrome]]. 
Let's see how this rolls out, because I am trying my best to keep up.
Another observation was that I feel I am getting lazy with AI and not writing enough, it's mostly giving AI the prompt and then it creates the doc, mostly it's not one shot and I have to keep prompting and giving it context until it gets it right, but still, I feel I am not contributing or learning enough, even though I have to learn more about the Product lifecycle, i feel I am caught up in just creating these docs. Maybe at a point this would make sense, maybe I am just easing myself in. 
I also need to learn how to actually write as well, this is what I am practising here.
